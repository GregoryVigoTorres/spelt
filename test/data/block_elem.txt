When you use Scrapy, you have to tell it which settings youâ€™re using. You can do this by using an environment variable, SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE.
The value of SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE should be in Python path syntax, e.g. myproject.settings. Note that the settings module should be on the Python import search path.
